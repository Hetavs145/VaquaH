## Responsive Design Principles Applied

### 1. Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile layout and progressively enhance for larger screens
- Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes for responsive classes

### 3. Responsive Typography
- Scale text sizes appropriately: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl`
- Ensure readability on all screen sizes

### 4. Responsive Spacing
- Progressive padding and margins: `py-4 sm:py-6 lg:py-8`
- Consistent gap scaling: `gap-4 sm:gap-6`

### 5. Responsive Components
- Buttons: Full width on mobile, auto width on larger screens
- Forms: Single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens
- Tables: Mobile-specific layouts with hidden headers on small screens

### 6. Touch-Friendly Design
- Adequate button sizes for mobile interaction
- Proper spacing between interactive elements
- Full-width buttons on mobile for easier tapping
