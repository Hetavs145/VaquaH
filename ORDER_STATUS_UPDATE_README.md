# Order Status Update and Automatic Deletion System

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of real-time order status updates for customers and automatic order deletion after 10 minutes of being marked as "success".

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Order Status Updates
- **Customer Dashboard**: Now uses Firebase real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`) to automatically update order status
- **Instant Updates**: Order status changes made by admins are immediately reflected in the customer dashboard
- **No Manual Refresh**: Customers no longer need to refresh the page to see status updates

### 2. Automatic Order Deletion
- **10-Minute Timer**: Orders marked as "success" are automatically deleted after 10 minutes
- **Cloud Functions**: Uses Firebase Cloud Functions to handle the deletion logic
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes orders and their timeline subcollections

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Status Notifications**: Customers receive real-time notifications when order status changes
- **Countdown Timers**: Visual countdown showing when "success" orders will be deleted
- **Admin Warnings**: Clear indication in admin panel about automatic deletion behavior

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### Customer Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
- Added Firebase real-time listeners using `onSnapshot`
- Implemented notification system for status changes
- Added countdown timer for orders marked as "success"
- Enhanced status display with better formatting

#### Admin Panel (`frontend/src/pages/admin/OrdersAdmin.jsx`)
- Added countdown timer display for "success" orders
- Added warning message about automatic deletion
- Enhanced status display with deletion countdown

### Backend Changes

#### Cloud Functions (`backend/functions/index.js`)
- **`scheduleOrderDeletion`**: Triggers when order status changes to "success"
- **`createOrderDeletionTask`**: Creates deletion tasks for processing
- **`processDeletionTasks`**: Scheduled function that runs every minute to process deletions

## How It Works

### 1. Order Status Update Flow
1. Admin updates order status in admin panel
2. Firebase document is updated in real-time
3. Customer dashboard automatically reflects the change via `onSnapshot`
4. Notification is shown to customer about status change

### 2. Automatic Deletion Flow
1. Order status is changed to "success" by admin
2. Cloud Function `scheduleOrderDeletion` is triggered
3. Deletion task is created in `deletionTasks` collection
4. `processDeletionTasks` function runs every minute
5. Orders older than 10 minutes are automatically deleted
6. Timeline subcollections are also cleaned up

## Database Collections

### New Collections
- **`deletionTasks`**: Stores pending deletion tasks
- **`scheduledTasks`**: Alternative approach for scheduled deletions

### Modified Collections
- **`orders`**: Now includes `updatedAt` timestamp for deletion tracking

## Configuration

### Firebase Functions
The functions are configured in `firebase.json` to use the `backend/functions` directory.

### Timing
- **Deletion Delay**: 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds)
- **Task Processing**: Every 1 minute
- **Notification Display**: 5 seconds

## Benefits

1. **Real-Time Updates**: Customers see order status changes immediately
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Reduces database clutter and improves performance
3. **Better UX**: Clear visual indicators and notifications
4. **Admin Awareness**: Admins know when orders will be automatically deleted

## Deployment

### Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
cd backend/functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Testing

### Test Order Status Updates
1. Create an order as a customer
2. Login as admin and change order status
3. Verify customer dashboard updates in real-time
4. Check notification appears

### Test Automatic Deletion
1. Mark order as "success" in admin panel
2. Verify countdown timer appears
3. Wait 10 minutes (or modify timing for testing)
4. Verify order is automatically deleted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Orders not updating in real-time**: Check Firebase connection and rules
2. **Deletion not working**: Verify Cloud Functions are deployed and running
3. **Countdown not showing**: Check `updatedAt` field exists on orders

### Debug Steps
1. Check Firebase console for function execution logs
2. Verify Firestore rules allow read/write access
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify real-time listeners are properly set up

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for status changes
2. **Custom Deletion Times**: Allow admins to set custom deletion delays
3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk status updates
4. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging of all order operations
5. **Mobile Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications on mobile devices
