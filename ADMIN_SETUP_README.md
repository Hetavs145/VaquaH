# 🔧 Fixing Firebase Permission Errors - Admin Setup Guide

## 🚨 Problem
You're getting Firebase permission errors like:
```
FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

This happens because:
1. **Collections don't exist** in Firestore
2. **User doesn't have admin role**
3. **Firebase functions aren't deployed**

## 🛠️ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firebase Functions
First, deploy the updated Firebase functions that include admin management:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /workspace

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 2: Initialize Collections (Option A - Quick Setup)
If you just want to create the collections without an admin user:

1. **Navigate to the AdminSetup component** in your app
2. **Click "Initialize Collections"** button
3. This will create sample data in:
   - `agents` collection
   - `agentApplications` collection  
   - `serviceRequests` collection
   - `adminLogs` collection

### Step 2: Create Admin User (Option B - Recommended)
To create a proper admin user with full access:

1. **Navigate to the AdminSetup component**
2. **Enter admin email and password**
3. **Click "Create Admin User"**
4. This will:
   - Create an admin user in Firebase Auth
   - Set admin custom claims
   - Create user document in Firestore
   - Initialize all collections

### Step 3: Log in as Admin
After creating the admin user:

1. **Log out** of your current account
2. **Log in** with the admin credentials you just created
3. **Navigate to ServicesAdmin** - it should now work without permission errors

## 📁 What Gets Created

### Collections Created:
- **`agents`** - Sample agent data
- **`agentApplications`** - Sample application data  
- **`serviceRequests`** - Sample service request data
- **`adminLogs`** - System initialization log

### Sample Data:
- 1 sample agent
- 1 sample application
- 1 sample service request
- System initialization log

## 🔐 Admin Access

Once set up, the admin user will have:
- ✅ Read/write access to all collections
- ✅ Ability to approve/deny agent applications
- ✅ Full admin dashboard access
- ✅ Custom claims for secure role checking

## 🚀 Alternative: Command Line Setup

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Run the setup script
node setup-admin.js

# This will deploy functions and rules automatically
```

## 🧪 Testing

After setup, test by:

1. **Logging in as admin**
2. **Navigating to ServicesAdmin page**
3. **Checking that data loads without errors**
4. **Verifying collections exist in Firebase Console**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If functions fail to deploy:
```bash
# Check Firebase CLI version
firebase --version

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Select project
firebase use <your-project-id>

# Try deploying again
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### If collections still don't exist:
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Verify collections were created
3. Check Firebase Functions logs for errors
4. Ensure you have proper Firebase permissions

### If admin user can't access:
1. Verify custom claims were set
2. Check user document in Firestore
3. Ensure Firestore rules are deployed
4. Check browser console for auth errors

- ✅ ServicesAdmin page loads with data
- ✅ Collections exist in Firebase Console
- ✅ Admin user has proper role claims
